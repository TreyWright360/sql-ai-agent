## 💼 Essential Assets

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch
> "I built an AI agent that converts natural language to SQL queries using a multi-agent architecture.
>
> The key innovation was implementing **schema context engineering** which improved query accuracy to 87%. I also focused heavily on safety, building a custom validation layer that ensures 100% read-only operations for data safety.
>
> It's currently deployed on Streamlit Cloud handling a database of 100,000 orders across 9 tables. Would you like to see a quick demo?"

### Copy-Paste Resume Bullets
*   **SQL AI Agent**: Built a natural language-to-SQL interface using Python and LangChain, enabling non-technical users to query complex databases with **87% accuracy**.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Architected a system with distinct specialized agents (SQL generation, validation, response formatting) to handle ambiguous queries and ensure data safety.
*   **Security & Validation**: Implemented a strict read-only validation layer that parses and sanitizes generated SQL before execution, preventing injection attacks and accidental writes.
*   **Deployment**: Deployed a fully functional demo to Streamlit Cloud, optimizing startup time to <3 seconds and handling concurrent user sessions.
